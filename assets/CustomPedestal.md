- Make a new unity project
- Download [this package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToniMacaroni/SaberFactory/main/assets/PedestalExporter.unitypackage)
- Import the package into your project (Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package)
- Any `GameObject` in the scene will now have an `Export Pedestal` button on top (in the inspector)
- Press it, go into the `Beat Saber\UserData\Saber Factory` folder and press `Save`
- There should now be a `pedestal` file in `Beat Saber\UserData\Saber Factory`
- Start Beat Saber, go into Saber Factory and your custom pedestal should show up
